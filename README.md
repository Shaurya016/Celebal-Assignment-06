In this task, we have to train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scoreand implement hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters. Also we have to analyze the results to select the best-performing model.
